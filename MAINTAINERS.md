ATTENTION
---------

    Please make sure before E-Mailing any of the person below that you have made sure
    that the changes are tested and releasable as submitted by you. If you want to report
    a bug please make sure that it is reproducable and be sure to include all necessary
    information to fix it.

    If you supply changes please prefer the Unix/Linux patch system (diff -u) as it will be least
    problematic to test and modify the development code. Again please be sure to submit
    your Hard-/Software configuration as patches will be rechecked by us and need to be
    mergable into the tree.

    Please do not forget to include credits or other acknowledgements in your submission.
    Before submitting anything please make sure that you have the proper rights to submit them
    and be prepared to submit all rights under the declared project License.
